Passbase
========

Passbase is a free password manager built on [Keybase](https://keybase.io).

Generate long, random, secure passwords and store encrypted copies of them on your Keybase File System.

[Soon, you'll also be able to share passwords with other Keybase users](#upcoming-features), at your discretion.

Usage
-----

**Whenever you create/change/read a password, it will open in `less`: this is to ensure it does not pollute your history, or remain visible on screen; once you have copied the password to your clipboard, press `q` to quit.**

Create a new password for cool-new-website:
```
passbase create cool-new-website
```

(Realise cool-new-website requires passwords to be at most 25 characters, and only contain the special characters `!` and `@`):
```
passbase change cool-new-website -n25 -S!@
```

Some time later, when you want to login to cool-new-website again:
```
passbase read cool-new-website
```

Get bored of cool-new-website:
```
passbase delete cool-new-website
```

What sites do we have passwords for again?
```
passbase list
```

I'd suggest creating an alias to help find and read your passwords, such as:
```
passbase read "$(passbase ls | fzf --no-preview --no-multi)" | pbcopy
```

which will fuzzy-find a password name, and then its value to the clipboard. (Example assumes POSIX shell on macOS.)

### Aliases

You can also use `ls` and `rm` as aliases for the obvious.

`--length` and `-n` are synonyms; as are `--specials` and `-S`.

You can specify not to use any special characters at all with `--no-specials` or `-x`. (cf. [Defaults](#defaults))

### Defaults

The default password length is `128` characters. This is not for any particular reason - if you're copy-pasting the length is rather immaterial, and it's rarely caused me any issues. That said, I'm definitely open to feedback; if you're frequently running into lower limits, please open an issue (if one doesn't exist).

Special characters included by default are ``~`!@Â£&*_+-=\,./|?`` - specified  characters may only be a subset of these. They were arrived at by being those on my keyboard that do not break 'double-tap copy'. Again, open to suggestions for changes.

Upcoming Features
-----------------

Keybase allows not only keeping things private, but also mutual privacy. The main goal of v0.2 will be to facilitate *shared passwords* - like the supermarket or pizza place you order from with roommates, or the video on demand subscription you share with family.

Installation
------------

macOS users can use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/):
```
brew install OJFord/formulae/passbase
```

or download [the latest release](https://github.com/OJFord/passbase/releases).

Development
-----------
[![CI Status](https://travis-ci.com/OJFord/passbase.svg?token=SxsettpUmvjPeVFxsTig&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/OJFord/passbase)

### Tests

The (integration) tests run inside a Docker container, primarily for ease of mocking the Keybase CLI tool and root directory.

```
docker-compose run tests
```
